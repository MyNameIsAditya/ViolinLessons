## Our Vision

We're just a couple of college students trying to make a difference in our world today. The United States has one of the lowest voter turnout rate across the globe and our aim is to change that. The United States stands at the forefront of democracy and represents both the freedom and power of voice. Now, more than ever, we, as citizens of the United States, must strive forward and use our voice to steer our country, and it's people, to a better future. Hopefully, with Election Essentials, individuals will become informed voters and will know how to cast their vote at Election Day. **Your voice matters. Your opinion matters. Your vote matters.**

We obtained a JSONObject from the API call that had information about political representatives; we then outputted that information on our Candidate page. More information about the Google Civic Information API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/civic-information).
2. **OpenFEC API:** Our team used this API to access and dynamically display information about current political representatives. Users can find this information by using the search bar on the Candidates page. We obtained a JSONObject from the API call that had information about political representatives; we then outputted that information on our Candidate page.
